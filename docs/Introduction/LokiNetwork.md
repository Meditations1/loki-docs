## Wallets
Wallets offer a gateway to private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold, secure and trade Loki with peers. [Download an official Loki wallet](https://loki.network/getting-started/) today and start taking back control of your online privacy.

## Mining
Mining on the Loki Network is the process of solving a difficult computational puzzle through a Proof-of-Work(PoW) protocol and compiling newly created transactions into a block. Miners do this in order to earn money from the [Block Reward](/Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#block-reward) and the fees associated from the transactions they include in each block. 

The Loki cryptocurrency can be mined using the CryptoNight Heavy hashing algorithm, which is designed to be [ASIC Resistant](../Mining/ASICResistance.md).

## Service Nodes
Loki utilises a network of [Service Nodes](../ServiceNodes/SNOverview.md) who are paid to propagate the blockchain and process transactions. Service Nodes require a [collateral](../ServiceNodes/SNOverview.md) of Loki to be active, this creates a built-in market-based [Sybil resistance](../Advanced/SybilResistance.md) by forcing actors to incur a large cost to attempt any form of temporal analysis on the network.

In addition, by rewarding the Service Nodes, the Service Nodes can be leveraged to maintain the [Lokinet](../Lokinet/LokinetOverview.md) by [routing traffic](../Lokinet/LLARP.md), and the [Loki Services](../LokiServices/LokiServicesOverview.md) by handling special off-chain activities, as seen in the [Loki Messenger](../LokiServices/Messenger.md).

## Lokinet
Lokinet is a new type of mixnet that uses market-based [Sybil attack resistance](../Advanced/SybilResistance.md) and [onion routing](../Lokinet/LLARP.md) to create a new way to privately access the [internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KzH_eyX99A&t=2m48s). Users of Lokinet will be able to access normal websites and [SNApps](../Lokinet/SNApps.md) without revealing their IP address.

SNApps are traditional web applications that sit inside Lokinet and are hidden from the rest of the internet. The hostâ€™s IP is never revealed, therefore SNApps provide great protection for the development of censorship resistant social media, marketplaces, information sharing sites, and other apps that depend on user and server anonymity.

## Loki Services
Loki Services are back-end user-facing applications, such as the [Loki Messenger](../LokiServices/LokiServicesOverview.md) and [Blink](../LokiServices/Blink.md). Off-chain networking and/or storage activities for these services are handled by [swarms](../Advanced/SwarmFlagging.md), groups of [Service Nodes](../ServiceNodes/SNOverview.md), who query eachother to enforce eachothers honesty. This creates a trustless environment where no centralised leader can enforce censorship on any of the off-chain activities conducted on the Loki Network.

## Advanced
Consider learning more about Loki by browsing through the Advanced section. Topics that are covered are [Technical Specs](../Advanced/TechnicalSpecs.md), [Loki's Cryptoeconomics](../Advanced/Cryptoeconomics.md), [Sybil Resistance](../Advanced/SybilResistance.md), [Dynamic Block Size](../Advanced/DynamicBlockSize.md) and Loki's [CryptoNote Elements](../Advanced/CryptoNoteElements.md) used.

Additionally you can find information on how Loki is going to mitigate [Denial of Service Attacks](../Advanced/DenialofServiceAttacks.md), [IP and Packet Blocking](../Advanced/IPandPacketBlocking.md), and nodes who are underperforming through [Swarm Flagging](../Advanced/SwarmFlagging.md).
